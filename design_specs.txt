DESIGN:

Inputs -
Reset Play/Pause Checkmark
Type to change number value (remembers for next iteration)

Click checkmark to "complete pomo stage":
  - Starts the next stage (work -> break or break -> work)
  - Clicking the checkmark during break will increment the pomo count
  
Click reset button to go back to beginning of stage:
  - Sets timer back to max
  - If timer already max, go to previous stage (and decrease pomo count if we are going back to our last break)
  
Click play/pause to pause/resume timer


UI:

When the timer hits 0, the page says "Break time" or "work time" but doesn't change until you hit check
Progress Bar for time remaining (maybe I can put the stage duration input here?)
Maybe carousel?
